## 1. Patch Summary

This patch stabilizes identifiers across the validated KAP source architecture (L0→L3) before metadata pilots and extraction pilots begin. It removes ambiguity from symbolic IDs (e.g., `FRAG-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`), preserves them as legacy aliases, defines canonical ID formats for all four levels, and creates a crosswalk mapping legacy IDs to canonical IDs.

## 2. Files Created / Updated

| File | Action | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| `02_Architecture/Synthesis/SOURCE-ID-NORMALIZATION-POLICY.md` | CREATED | Full canonical ID policy — L0→L3 formats, stability rules, legacy preservation, collision prevention |
| `05_Registries/SOURCE-FRAGMENT-ID-CROSSWALK.md` | CREATED | 9 legacy IDs mapped to canonical SF-* IDs, 0 unresolved |
| `05_Registries/SOURCE-OBJECT-REGISTRY.md` | UPDATED | 27 objects with canonical SO-* IDs, next-seq table, pending population list |
| `05_Registries/SOURCE-FRAGMENT-REGISTRY.md` | UPDATED | 9 fragments with canonical SF-* IDs, legacy IDs preserved, next-seq table |
| `02_Architecture/Synthesis/_schemas/source_fragment.schema.json` | UPDATED (v2) | v1.2 — added `source_object_id`, `source_instance_id`, `source_channel_id`, `id_normalization_status`, `legacy_fragment_ids`; `fragment_id` pattern restricted to SF-* canonical only; legacy FRAG-* IDs only in `legacy_fragment_ids` |
| `07_AI_Indexes/source_fragment_index.json` | UPDATED (v2) | v1.2 — canonical ID policy reference, crosswalk path, legacy ID warning, **all 9 fragments** (including previously omitted FRAG-20260703-AD03 → SF-GIT-001-0020-001 and FRAG-20260703-AD05 → SF-GIT-001-0022-001) |
| `05_Registries/KAP-SOURCE-MATRIX.md` | UPDATED | ID normalization status table added (L0→L3 all CANONICAL) |
| `06_Reports/Gates/SOURCE-FRAGMENT-ID-NORMALIZATION-PATCH-REPORT.md` | CREATED | This file |

## 3. Canonical ID Policy Summary

| Level | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| L0 Source Channel | `CH-XXX` | `CH-001` (Git), `CH-002` (ChatGPT) |
| L1 Source Instance | `<CHANNELCODE>-XXX` | `GIT-001`, `GPT-002`, `MAN-001` |
| L2 Source Object | `SO-<CHANNELCODE>-<INSTANCESEQ>-<OBJECTSEQ>` | `SO-GIT-001-0001` |
| L3 Source Fragment | `SF-<CHANNELCODE>-<INSTANCESEQ>-<OBJECTSEQ>-<FRAGMENTSEQ>` | `SF-GIT-001-0001-001` |

**Key rules:**
- IDs are immutable. Path/title/URL changes do not change IDs.
- Sequential assignment within parent scope. No reuse.
- `SOURCE-OBJECT-REGISTRY.md` and `SOURCE-FRAGMENT-REGISTRY.md` track next available sequence numbers.

---

## 4. Legacy ID Handling Summary

| Legacy ID Pattern | Preservation Method | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `FRAG-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` | `legacy_fragment_ids` array in schema + crosswalk | 9 mapped |
| `SF-001`, `SF-002`... | No instances found in committed registries | 0 |

**All 9 legacy IDs mapped. 0 unresolved.**

---

## 5. Crosswalk Summary

## 11. Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| FRAG-20260703-AD03 and FRAG-20260703-AD05 were missing from source_fragment_index.json | RESOLVED | Added in v2 patch. All 9 fragments now consistent across REGISTRY, CROSSWALK, and INDEX. |
| SO-* IDs for GIT-002→GIT-041 (39 repos) not yet assigned | Non-blocking | Will be assigned during GITHUB-SOURCE-ACQUISITION-GATE |

---

## 12. Blockers

None. All required files exist in Git.

---

## 13. Recommended Next Gate

**PROCESS-DOCS-RUNBOOK-GATE** — define the operational runbook for running metadata pilots and controlled extraction pilots against ACQUIRED sources.

## 14. Final Status

```
SOURCE_FRAGMENT_ID_NORMALIZATION_PATCH_PASS_READY_FOR_PROCESS_DOCS_RUNBOOK_GATE
```

> **v2 corrections applied (Guardian Architect patch):**
> 1. `fragment_id` pattern restricted to `SF-*` canonical only — legacy FRAG-* IDs only in `legacy_fragment_ids`
> 2. All 9 fragments now consistent across SOURCE-FRAGMENT-REGISTRY.md, SOURCE-FRAGMENT-ID-CROSSWALK.md, and source_fragment_index.json
